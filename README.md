# DIPS 4d tracking

**Goal:** Preprocessing and training code for training DIPS on a generic Ntuple.

## Step 1: Setup

Clone this repo.

## Step 2: Preprocessing

## Step 3: Training

## TO DO

- Add the lifetime IP sign
- Implement a prompt muon / lepton veto
- Use resampling for the FTAG training instead
- Brainstorm with Lorenzo to add the rest of the track quality inputs to the Ntuple
